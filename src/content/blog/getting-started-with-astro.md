# Getting Started with Astro: A Beginner's Guide

Astro is revolutionizing how we build websites by focusing on performance and simplicity. In this guide, we'll explore what makes Astro special and how to get started.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default. It allows you to use your favorite JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) while generating static HTML for optimal performance.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Performance First
- Ships zero JavaScript by default
- Partial hydration for interactive components
- Optimized build output

### 🧩 Component Islands
- Use multiple frameworks in the same project
- Each component is an "island" that can be hydrated independently
- Mix and match React, Vue, Svelte, and more

### 📝 Content Collections
- Type-safe content management
- Markdown and MDX support
- Automatic TypeScript types generation

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Astro project
npm create astro@latest

# Navigate to your project
cd my-astro-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

```
my-astro-site/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── content/
├── public/
└── astro.config.mjs
```

## Your First Component

Create a simple component in `src/components/`:

```astro
---
export interface Props {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="card">
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <p>{description}</p>
</div>

<style>
  .card {
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
</style>
```

## Next Steps

Once you have Astro set up, explore:

1. **Content Collections** for managing blog posts
2. **Integrations** for adding Tailwind, React, or other tools
3. **Deployment** options like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages

Astro's approach to web development prioritizes performance without sacrificing developer experience. Give it a try for your next project!
